# Packet Squirrel Versions 

There are currently two versions of the Packet Squirrel.  The original Packet Squirrel can be identified by the micro-usb power port, while the Packet Squirrel Mark II can be identified by the USB-C power port.

Please make sure you select payloads for the device you have!

Payloads for the original Packet Squirrel be found in the `legacy-mk1/` directory.

The Packet Squirrel Mark II payloads can be found in the `payloads/` directory.

The Packet Squirrel Mark II expands the DuckyScript for Packet Squirrel commands and adds many new commands and features.  In general, payloads from the original Packet Squirrel can be adapted to run on the Packet Squirrel Mark II by adopting the new commands - check out the [Packet Squirrel Mark II Payload documentation](https://docs.hak5.org/packet-squirrel-mark-ii/payload-development/duckyscript-for-packet-squirrel) for more information!

The existing suite of original Packet Squirrel payloads remains available and functional on the original hardware in the `legacy-mk1/` directory!

<br/><i>Hak5 Packet Squirrel Features</i>
</p>
<br/>

The Packet Squirrel Mark II is an Ethernet multi-tool for packet capture, man-in-the-middle network manipulation, stream filtering and redirection, remote VPN access, and more.

Use simplified DuckyScript for Packet Squirrel to create payloads, or unlock the full power of Bash script or Python 3 for complex payloads.

Edit payloads live in the Web UI editor with syntax highlighting, SSH, or [build your payloads with Payload Studio](https://payloadstudio.hak5.org).

Exfiltrate data or pentest from anywhere with [Hak5 Cloud C²](https://shop.hak5.org/products/c2 "Hak5 Cloud C²").


## Naming Conventions

Please give your payload a unique, descriptive and appropriate name. Do not use spaces in payload, directory or file names. Each payload should be submit into its own directory, with `-` or `_` used in place of spaces, to one of the categories such as exfiltration, interception, sniffing, or recon. Do not create your own category.

The payload itself should be named `payload`.

Additional files and documentation can be included in the payload directory.  Documentation should be in `README.md` or `README.txt`.

## Payload Configuration

In many cases, payloads will require some level of configuration by the end payload user. Be sure to take the following into careful consideration to ensure your payload is easily tested, used and maintained. 

- Remember to use PLACEHOLDERS for configurable portions of your payload - do not share your personal URLs, API keys, Passphrases, etc...
- Do not leave defaults that point at live services
- Make note of both required and optional configuration(s) in your payload using comments at the top of your payload or "inline" where applicable

## Payload Format

Payloads should begin with comments specifying at the very least the name of the payload and author. Additional information such as a brief description, the target, any dependencies / prerequisites and the LED status used is helpful.

    # Title: Example payload
	# Description: Example payload with configuration options
	# Author: Hak5
	# Version: 1.0
	# Category: Remote-Access
	# Net Mode: NAT
	#
	# LED State Descriptions
	# Magenta Solid - Configuring NETMODE
	# LED OFF - Waiting for BUTTON
	# Red Blink 2 Times - Connection Failed
	# Amber Blink 5 Times - Connection Successful
	# Red Blink 1 Time - Command Failed
	# Cyan Blink 1 Time - Command Successful

### Configuration Options

Configurable options should be specified in variables at the top of the payload file:

    # Options
    SSH_USER="username"
	SSH_HOST="hostname"
    PORT=31337

### NETMODE

All payloads should include a `NETMODE` command to set the Packet Squirrel to a useful network mode.

When in doubt, `NETMODE NAT` is a reasonable default.

### LED

The payload should use common payload states rather than unique color/pattern combinations when possible with an LED command preceding the Stage or `NETMODE`.

	LED SETUP
	NETMODE NAT

Common payload states include a `SETUP`, with may include a `FAIL` if certain conditions are not met. This is typically followed by either a single `ATTACK` or multiple `STAGEs`. More complex payloads may include a `SPECIAL` function to wait until certain conditions are met. Payloads commonly end with a `CLEANUP` phase, such as moving and deleting files or stopping services. A payload may `FINISH` when the objective is complete and the device is safe to eject or turn off. These common payload states correspond to `LED` states.
